        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have work experience in the United States as a Project Design Engineer Intern in the Energy Department at Tesla Inc located in Austin, Texas, USA. I designed Supercharger, Megapack (BESS), and PV Solar construction plan sets for turnkey utility, commercial, and industrial projects. This contributes to accelerating the EV ecosystem globally by providing the deployment of Supercharger project designs.

As a professional, I have 8 years of experience working as an assistant manager, project leader, project coordinator, project planner, instructor, and inspector on various national strategic utility projects in Indonesia. These projects include extra high voltage 500 kV substations, overhead line transmission, underground cables, and gas-insulated substation projects.

Moreover, I have several international publications, such as "Integration Scheme for Electric Vehicles Charging with Modular Substation and Photovoltaic Shelter," published in IEEE and SCOPUS journals. Additionally, my paper titled "Strategic Evaluation of Extra High Voltage Substation on Transmission Backbone 500 kV Sumatera Project, Indonesia" was published at CEPSI 2021: The Energy Digicon of Asia-Pacific.

Currently, I am a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, sponsored by the Fulbright Scholarship from the United States Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Furthermore, I am part of Global Fulbright Community consisting of multi-cultural, diversity, and world wide open-minded perspectives. </p>
